Hello and thank you for visiting my blog! I'm a software engineer and a lifelong learner. My interests in technology span from AI tools, web applications, self-driving vehicles and web animation.

Sometimes you'll find me toying with a raspberry pi, walking my dog or hiking up a tall mountain.

I try to cover topics of things that I've done and experience that I think could be relevant to other mid-level software engineers.
