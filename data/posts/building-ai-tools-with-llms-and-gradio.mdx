draft: false
summary: "This project is an AI-powered customer support assistant for a fictional airline called FlightAI. It leverages language models (like GPT-4o-mini) for chat interactions, DALL-E-3 for image generation (e.g., of destination cities), and OpenAI's text-to-speech model for audio responses. The user interface is built with Gradio."

## Getting Started with LLM Engineering

I've been diving into the world of Large Language Model (LLM) engineering through an excellent [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/) led by industry veteran Ed Donner. This comprehensive program takes you through real-world projects that demonstrate practical applications of AI technology in business scenarios.

Currently about 25% through the course, I've already had hands-on experience with multiple AI platforms including OpenAI, Anthropic, and locally running models like Ollama. The course covers advanced techniques such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation), and AI Agents - all essential tools in the modern AI developer's toolkit.

## The FlightAI Assistant Project

One of the most engaging projects I completed was the **AI-powered customer support assistant** for a fictional airline called FlightAI. This project perfectly demonstrates how multiple AI services can work together to create a comprehensive user experience.

The assistant leverages several cutting-edge AI models:
- **GPT-4o-mini** for natural language chat interactions
- **DALL-E-3** for generating images of destination cities
- **OpenAI's TTS-1** for converting text responses to speech

You can check out the complete project code in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryan-griego/ai-airline-assistant).

## Discovering Gradio for Rapid Prototyping

One of the most valuable tools introduced in the course is **Gradio**, an open-source Python library that's a game-changer for AI developers. Gradio enables you to quickly build user-friendly web interfaces for AI models, APIs, or any Python function with minimal code.

What makes Gradio particularly appealing is its ability to:
- Create professional-looking demos in minutes
- Generate live URLs for instant sharing
- Provide an intuitive interface without requiring web development expertise

The speed at which you can go from a working AI model to a shareable web application is truly impressive.

## Development Environment and Setup

The course utilizes a robust development stack:
- **Anaconda** platform for managing Python environments and dependencies
- **Jupyter Lab** as the primary development environment for working with notebooks, code, and data

While the course materials use Jupyter notebooks, I decided to export my project to a standalone Python file. This approach gave me more flexibility to run the application outside of the Jupyter platform and better understand the underlying code structure.

## Learning About Function Calling with LLMs

One of the most fascinating concepts I encountered was the ability to extend LLM capabilities through **function calling**. This technique allows the AI model to execute custom functions as part of its response generation process.

In the airline assistant project, I implemented this by:
1. Creating custom functions (like `get_ticket_price`)
2. Passing these functions as tools to the chat completions API
3. Allowing the LLM to intelligently decide when to call these functions

For example, when a user asks about ticket prices, the LLM automatically triggers the `get_ticket_price` function, which searches through a dictionary of city names and prices to return accurate pricing information. This seamless integration of custom logic with AI responses creates a much more powerful and practical application.

## Conclusion

The combination of powerful AI models, intuitive development tools like Gradio, and techniques like function calling opens up endless possibilities for creating practical AI applications.

The experience of building a multi-modal AI assistant that can chat, generate images, and speak has given me a solid foundation for tackling more complex projects as I continue through the course. I'm excited to explore the remaining 75% of the curriculum and see what other innovative applications I can build.
