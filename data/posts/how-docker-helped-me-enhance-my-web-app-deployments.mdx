## Introduction

Deploying web applications has always been a critical aspect of my full stack development journey. Since the beginning of 2021, I’ve been deploying my apps on AWS EC2 instances, and while AWS offers powerful tools, I noticed a steady increase in my monthly fees each year. Additionally, managing deployments and ensuring consistency across environments became increasingly cumbersome. Enter Docker—a game-changer that not only slashed my hosting costs by 75% but also improved the way I deploy and manage my web applications.

## The Rising Costs of AWS EC2

When I first started deploying my web applications on AWS EC2 in early 2021, the flexibility and control AWS provided were unparalleled. However, as my projects grew, so did my monthly expenses. Each year, my AWS fees on the EC2 instances kept creeping up. The high costs were primarily due to the need for multiple instances to handle different applications and their unique dependencies. Managing these instances manually was not only time-consuming but also prone to errors.

## Discovering Docker: A Cost-Effective Solution

Transitioning to Docker dramatically transformed my deployment process. By containerizing my applications, I was able to consolidate multiple services onto a single DigitalOcean droplet, significantly reducing my hosting fees. Docker’s lightweight containers are more resource-efficient compared to traditional virtual machines, allowing me to maximize the use of my server resources without compromising performance.

Reduced Deployment Time

One of the most significant benefits I experienced was the reduction in deployment time. With Docker, deploying both existing and new applications became more streamlined. Containers encapsulate all the necessary dependencies, ensuring that my apps run consistently across different environments. This eliminated the notorious "it works on my machine" problem, as the container guarantees that the application behaves the same way locally and on the live server.

Consistent Environments with Containerization

The ability to run and test Docker containers locally and know they will work identically on a live server has been invaluable. This consistency minimizes issues during launches, as the environments are virtually identical. Docker ensures that all dependencies are packaged within the container, reducing the risk of environment-specific bugs and incompatibilities.


## Leveraging AI: Generating Dockerfiles with ChatGPT

Embarking on my Docker journey was daunting at first, especially when it came to writing Dockerfiles from scratch. Fortunately, with the help of ChatGPT, I was able to generate Dockerfiles. By describing what technologies were made with and pasting in my package.json, ChatGPT assisted in creating a Dockerfile tailored to my application's needs.

## Portability Across Cloud Providers

One of Docker’s standout features is its portability. Knowing that my Docker containers can run on different cloud providers gives me the flexibility to switch platforms without significant reconfiguration. This portability ensures that I’m not locked into a single provider, allowing me to choose the best services and pricing options available.

## Simplifying Multi-App Deployments with Docker Compose

Deploying multiple applications used to be a hassle, especially when each app had its own set of dependencies. Docker Compose has been instrumental in managing multi-container Docker applications. By defining all the services in a docker-compose.yml file, I can deploy multiple apps to DigitalOcean effortlessly. Docker Compose handles the orchestration, networking, and dependencies between containers, making the deployment process smooth and efficient.

Navigating the New Workflow

Transitioning to Docker meant adjusting to new workflows, such as SSHing into servers without directly accessing project directories. Initially, it felt strange not having immediate visibility into the file structure. However, Docker provides robust logging capabilities, allowing me to monitor the logs output by each container. Docker logs make it easy to track application behavior and troubleshoot issues without needing direct access to the server’s file system.

## Overcoming Challenges with AWS EC2

Deploying to AWS EC2 was not without its challenges. Managing environments to support multiple applications with different dependencies often led to conflicts and compatibility issues. Each application required a specific setup, and ensuring that all dependencies worked harmoniously on a single instance was a constant struggle. Docker eliminated these issues by isolating each application within its own container, allowing different dependencies to coexist without interference.

## Moving Forward: Enhancing with Multiple Containers

While Docker has already improved my deployment process, there’s still room for growth. One area I’m focusing on is running multiple containers for a single application, such as integrating a PostgreSQL database in its own container for a full-stack application. This separation of concerns not only enhances scalability but also simplifies maintenance and updates. Docker’s versatility offers endless possibilities, and I’m excited to explore and implement more advanced containerization techniques in the future.

## Docker’s Lesser-Known Capabilities

Beyond the obvious benefits, Docker possesses several features that significantly enhance the developer experience:

- Networking: Docker’s networking capabilities allow containers to communicate seamlessly, whether they’re on the same host or distributed across multiple hosts.
- Volumes: Persistent storage in Docker is managed through volumes, ensuring that data remains intact even if containers are recreated or updated.
- Docker Swarm and Kubernetes Integration: For those looking to scale further, Docker integrates with orchestration tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes, enabling scalable deployment strategies.
- Security: Docker offers built-in security features, such as namespaces and control groups, to isolate containers and protect the host system from potential vulnerabilities.

These features not only improve productivity but also empower developers to implement DevOps practices more effectively. Docker bridges the gap between development and operations, putting powerful deployment and management tools directly into the hands of developers.

## Integrating GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment

Looking ahead, my next goal is to integrate GitHub Actions into my workflow to automate the building and deploying of Docker containers. For example, building this very blog with Next.js can be seamlessly automated using GitHub Actions, ensuring that every push to the repository triggers a build and deployment process. This continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will further enhance my development workflow, reducing manual intervention and increasing deployment reliability.

## Retaining AWS for Continued Learning

Despite the numerous advantages Docker offers, I’m not abandoning AWS entirely. I plan to retain an AWS server to continue learning and applying AWS practices. AWS provides a vast array of services and tools that are invaluable for comprehensive cloud development and deployment strategies.

## Conclusion

Docker has been a transformative tool in my web development journey, enabling me to reduce costs, speed up deployments, and ensure consistency across environments. The transition from traditional EC2 instances to containerized deployments on DigitalOcean has not only been financially beneficial but has also enhanced my productivity and deployment reliability. With Docker’s powerful features and the ongoing integration of automation tools like GitHub Actions, I’m excited about the future of my web app deployments. As I continue to explore Docker’s capabilities and expand my cloud expertise, I’m confident that containerization will remain a cornerstone of my development workflow.
