## Introduction

Searching for a job can be a daunting task, often involving meticulous tracking of applications, remembering to follow up, and finding ways to stand out among other applicants. To address these challenges, I decided to leverage my software development skills and create **Job Getter**—an application designed to improve the job hunting process through automation and integration of various tools.

## Challenges in Job Hunting

In previous job searches, I found myself:

- **Manually Tracking Applications**: Relying on spreadsheets to remember where I applied and when to follow up.
- **Forgetting to Follow Up**: Missing opportunities to reconnect with hiring managers due to lack of reminders.
- **Struggling to Stand Out**: Sending generic emails that failed to capture the attention of employers.

These challenges highlighted the need for a more efficient system to manage my job search activities.

## Introducing Job Getter

**Job Getter** is an application built using **Nuxt** and **MongoDB**, aimed at automating the job application process. It helps users track job applications, retrieve hiring contacts, and send customized emails—all from a single platform.

## Core Features

Scraping Job Listings

Utilizing the **PhantomBuster API**, Job Getter can scrape job postings from LinkedIn and store the information in a **MongoDB** database. This automates the tedious process of collecting job details and ensures that no potential opportunity is overlooked.

Manual Job Entry

For jobs found outside of LinkedIn or those not captured by the scraper, users can manually add job listings through a simple form. This flexibility ensures that all applications are tracked, regardless of their source.

Retrieving Hiring Contacts

The app integrates with the **Hunter.io API** to fetch hiring managers' work email addresses. Given the limitations of Hunter.io's free plan, I also incorporated **Apollo.io** and **Clearbit** to expand the pool of accessible contacts.

Sending Customized Emails

With the **SendGrid API**, users can send [personalized HTML emails](https://res.cloudinary.com/dm7y3yvjp/image/upload/v1730237308/html-email-sample_oycnvu.png) to hiring contacts directly from the app. This feature allows for more professional and eye-catching communication compared to plain text emails.

Generating QR Codes

Job Getter can generate QR codes that embed the hiring contact's name, company, and job title into a URL. This can link to a landing page showcasing a user's introduction video or video resume, adding a unique touch to applications.

## Technologies and Services Used

MongoDB Atlas

To keep costs minimal, I opted for **MongoDB Atlas**'s free tier for cloud database services. This choice provides scalability and ease of use without upfront expenses.

SendGrid

**SendGrid** offers a free plan allowing up to 100 emails per day, making it an ideal choice for managing email communications within the app.

Hunter.io, Apollo.io, and Clearbit

While **Hunter.io** provides 25 free email lookups per month, combining it with **Apollo.io** and **Clearbit** expands the ability to retrieve hiring contacts, ensuring that users have the best chance of connecting with potential employers.

PhantomBuster

I leveraged a free trial account with **PhantomBuster**, which grants daily automation credits. This tool is essential for tasks like scraping LinkedIn job listings and automating connection requests.

Tabulator

Tabulator is a JavaScript library for creating interactive, customizable tables on web pages with features like sorting, filtering, pagination, and data editing. It’s highly flexible and integrates easily with frameworks, offering responsive design and extensive styling options.

## Lessons Learned in App Development

Developing **Job Getter** provided valuable insights:

- **User-Centric Design**: Realizing that to make the app usable for others, features like sending emails from a user's own email address need to be implemented.
- **Early Deployment**: Launching early allowed me to test the app in a production environment, identify issues, and explore automation opportunities.
- **Workflow Optimization**: By dissecting each step of the job application process, I was able to minimize unnecessary clicks and keystrokes, enhancing efficiency.

## Future Enhancements

Automated Follow-Ups

Implementing a daily **CRON job** to:

- Check the status of applications.
- Send customized follow-up emails based on specific time intervals (e.g., one day or one week after applying).

Multiple Hiring Contacts

Allowing users to:

- Add multiple contacts to a single job listing.
- Increase the chances of a response by reaching out to various stakeholders within a company.

Additional Email Templates

Expanding the email template library to include:

- **Post-Interview Thank You**: Express gratitude after interviews.
- **Second Follow-Up**: Send reminders if there's no initial response.
- **Feedback Request**: Seek feedback on unsuccessful applications.

Design Improvements

- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Inspired by platforms like Remote Rocketship, plan to revamp the interface for a more engaging user experience.
- **Search Filters**: Implement advanced filtering options to easily navigate through job listings.
- **Color Coding**: Use visual cues to indicate urgency levels and application statuses.

## Conclusion

Building **Job Getter** has transformed my approach to job hunting, making it more organized and efficient. The app not only addresses common challenges faced by job seekers but also serves as a testament to the power of integrating multiple technologies to solve real-world problems. As I continue to refine and enhance the app, I aim to make it a valuable tool for others navigating the job market. If you want to see the app in action, click on the Video Demonstration link below.
